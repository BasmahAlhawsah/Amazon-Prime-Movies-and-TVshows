# Amazon Prime Movies and TV shows Dashboard

## Problem Statement

Prime Video, with an extensive catalog of thousands of movies and TV shows, needs an efficient way to analyze and understand its content library. The goal is to gain insights into the distribution and composition of titles based on genre, age rating, release year, and geographical origin. Without a consolidated view, decision-makers face challenges in assessing content variety, identifying audience preferences, and aligning content strategy with viewer demands.

This Power BI dashboard addresses these challenges by providing a centralized and interactive visual representation of Prime Videoâ€™s catalog. The dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly analyze genre trends, rating distributions, content growth over time, and country-specific data. With these insights, the platform can better cater to audience needs, make data-driven programming decisions, and optimize content offerings.
